Squamous,,,,"My daughter has developed a concerning skin lesion. It presents as flat, thin cells found in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis), appearing as either a firm, red nodule or a flat lesion with a scaly or crusty surface. While it can manifest anywhere on the body, it seems to be most prevalent on sun-exposed areas such as the head, neck, hands, and arms. Given its potential to progress into squamous cell carcinoma, I'm eager to have it assessed and treated promptly by a dermatologist."

Squamous,,,,"My son has developed a rough, reddish, scaly area on his skin. I believe this may be due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds, as well as other factors such as his older age, fair skin, history of sunburns, and potential exposure to certain chemicals or radiation. I'm worried about the implications if left untreated, as it can grow and invade nearby tissues, leading to disfigurement and potentially spreading to other parts of the body through metastasis. We're seeking your expertise to confirm the diagnosis and provide guidance on the appropriate treatment plan."
